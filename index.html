  <h1>Pop Quiz - var, let, const, hoisting</h1>
  <h2>What is the difference between <strong>var</strong> and <strong>let</strong>?</h2>
  <p><strong>var</strong> declared variables can get re-declared. Variables declared with
    <strong>var</strong> are also accessible in the windows object, window.xxx. <strong>var</strong>
    declared variables will hoist to the top of the scope where it is
    declared. The scope for variables declared with <strong>var</strong> is the function where it was declared,
    regardless of code block. Variables declared with <strong>var</strong> can change. </p>
  <p><strong>let</strong> declared variables canNOT get re-declared and they also do NOT
    'hoist'. Variables declared with <strong>let</strong> are not added to the window object.
    The scope for variables declared with <strong>let</strong> is block scope -- the variable is
    only known
    to all the code within the { and } where the variable was declared with <strong>let</strong>.
    Variables declared with <strong>let</strong> can change. </p>

  <h2>What is the difference between <strong>var</strong> and <strong>const</strong>?</h2>
  <p>Same as above: <strong>let</strong> declared variables canNOT get re-declared and they also do NOT
    'hoist'. Variables declared with <strong>let</strong> are not added to the window object.
    The scope for variables declared with <strong>let</strong> is block scope -- the variable is
    only known
    to all the code within the { and } where the variable was declared with <strong>let</strong>.
    Variables declared with <strong>let</strong> can change. </p>
  <p><strong>const</strong> declared variables function in the same way as let-declared
    variables except <strong>const</strong> are CONSTant and cannot change from the value assigned
    when declared. The big caveat are reference objects -- the properties and values within the
    object can change but the reference to the object cannot change. </p>

  <p></p>
  <h2>What is the difference between <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>?</h2>
  <p>Covered above. let-declared variables can change, const-declared things cannot change.
    (reference-object exception caveat). </p>
  <h2>What is hoisting?</h2>
  <p>Hoisting is applicable to <strong>var</strong> declared variables. With hoisting, the
    declaration of the <strong>var</strong>
    happens at the top of the scope / function regardless of where it is initialized and used.
    The var is not assigned a value until the assign is encountered in code. The variable is
    undefined (instead of hard error not declared) when the var-declared variable is
    referenced in code before it was actually assigned.</p>
  <p>Contrasting with <strong>let</strong>, the declaration occurs where the variable is
    declared in the
    code block. Referencing a <strong>let</strong>-declared variable before it is declared
    will cause a not declared hard error (not sure if only the function will not run or the
    entire script file).
